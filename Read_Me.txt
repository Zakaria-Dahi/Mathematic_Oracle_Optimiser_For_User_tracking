- This repository contains the implementation files of the Takeover Time-Driven Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithm (TD-EA)
for solving the Mobility Management Problem (MMP) in cellular networks. 

- The file "Instance" contains also all the test cases (instances) used in the experiments.

- To run the TD-EA, execute the file "main".

- It is prefered that you use Matlab R2014a to run the code as it is. 

- If you use newer versions of Matlab, you will probably need to update some obselete functions such as "Mat2Cell".
